      <p>It&rsquo;s June of 2019, and political tensions are at an all-time high. Fear of election
      fraud, either from fears of hacking or double voting, is widespread on all political sides.
      Do you know what this country needs? Another hot take on the Interstate Voter Registration
      Crosscheck system.</p>
      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of excellent criticisms leveled at this system. For those of you
      not familiar with it, the Crosscheck system takes voting records from all participating
      states, then checks for any duplicate people. The stated purpose is to prevent double voting,
      which is where one person votes twice, each in two different states. The main problem with
      its system is with <em>how</em> it detects duplicate voters: it compares first name, last
      name, and date of birth. That&rsquo;s it. It doesn&rsquo;t consider middle name(s), social
      security numbers, physical appearance, or any other metric.</p>
      <p>There is one main problem with this: <em>lots of people have common names.</em> I would be
      willing to bet that there are two &ldquo;Justin Smith&rdquo;s living in Kansas City, MO
      <em>alone</em> without considering all cities in the 27 states that are <em>still using</em>
      Crosscheck. It doesn&rsquo;t help that because of the distribution of surnames in the United
      States, <a href=
      "https://web.archive.org/web/20190511082031/https://www.healthofstatedemocracies.org/factors/intercross.html">
      white people are underrepresented in matches by 8%, while people of color can be
      overrepresented by anywhere from 24% to 45% depending on racial category.</a> Clearly, this
      is not an unbiased system.</p>
      <p>Oh, and by the way, voter fraud isn&rsquo;t widespread. I came across <a href=
      "https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/13/voter-fraud-real-heres-proof/">this article in the
      Federalist</a> that claims there are &ldquo;a stunning 18 million invalid voter registrations
      on the books.&rdquo; Their source is <a href=
      "https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/pewupgradingvoterregistrationpdf.pdf">
      this study from the Pew Charitable Trust</a>, which does indeed include that number, <em>if
      you count people whose addresses have changed as invalid registrations.</em> While that
      certainly is a discrepancy that needs to be checked, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there are
      18 million fraudulent votes cast every year.</p>
      <p>For a second though, let&rsquo;s pretend that none of that mattered. Let&rsquo;s pretend
      that the metric used to match people was far more accurate, that it still had a reasonably
      good change of catching fraudulent votes, and that voter fraud was very widespread. <em>It
      would still be a bad system.</em></p>
      <h2 id="bayesian-analysis">Bayesian Analysis</h2>
      <p>I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much of this post explaining Bayesian statistics; <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics">Wikipedia has a pretty good summary of
      it</a>. In short, given the following probabilities that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A person has voted fraudulently</li>
        <li>A person&rsquo;s vote has been marked as fraudulent</li>
        <li>Given a person has voted fraudulently, they have been marked such</li>
      </ol>
      <p>we can determine how likely it is that a person whose vote has been marked as fraudulent
      did indeed vote fraudulently. That&rsquo;s a lot, so I&rsquo;m not going to use the formula,
      but rather a verbal explanation of it.</p>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s set up some probabilities as an example. Let&rsquo;s say that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If you voted legitimately, Crosscheck has a 0.1% chance of marking you fraudulent</li>
        <li>If you voted fraudulently, Crosscheck has a 99% chance of marking you fraudulent,
        and</li>
        <li>1 in 1000 people vote fraudulently.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now let&rsquo;s apply those probabilities to a sample of one million people.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>99% of fraudulent votes are caught: that&rsquo;s 990 votes.</li>
        <li>0.1% of legitimate votes are marked fraudulent: that&rsquo;s 999 votes.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Even with extremely effective false-positive and false-negative rates, a greater number of
      legitimate votes is marked as fraudulent. The numbers are close to equal, but this still
      shows that even with quite high rates of voter fraud, a system like Crosscheck needs to be
      extremely reliable to be effective at all. In practice? <a href=
      "https://5harad.com/papers/1p1v.pdf">This study</a> suggests that for every fraudulent vote
      prevented, approximately 300 legitimate votes are rejected.</p>
      <p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound like democracy to me.</p>
