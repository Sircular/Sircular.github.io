      <p>Since it&rsquo;s the new year, it&rsquo;s <em>allegedly</em> a new me, and starting this
      semester, I&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to take a few English classes. I&rsquo;m starting
      with Intro to Fiction writing, and I&rsquo;m thinking of publishing a few of the things that
      I write in that class on here. Although a lot of the coursework is going to be composed
      writing exercises that don&rsquo;t have, y&rsquo;know, plots or character development, I do
      know that I&rsquo;ll be writing a couple short stories at some point this semester. So if
      you&rsquo;re interested in reading them, I&rsquo;ll probably make a new section on my website
      for those.</p>
      <p>Oh also, Happy New Year. Maybe I should have posted about that.</p>
