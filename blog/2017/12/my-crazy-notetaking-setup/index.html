      <p>Without going into too much detail, let&rsquo;s just say that I enjoy messing with my
      workflow far too much. I&rsquo;m constantly trying to get a more efficient setup, a faster,
      newer, better, shinier plugin, and a more robust tool to use. I have an addiction for
      configuration. However, for the past few months, I&rsquo;ve found a workflow that works
      pretty consistently for me.</p>
      <h2 id="note-taking">Note-Taking</h2>
      <p>I take all of my notes in Vim. I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to determine whether this is
      because I&rsquo;m very efficient in Vim, or because I&rsquo;m a little bit masochistic.
      (Hint: it&rsquo;s a bit of both.) I take all of my notes in Markdown, which I find very easy
      to write, read, and use. It&rsquo;s especially nice when I want to generate a study guide for
      my classes, since I can use the amazing <code>pandoc</code> command.</p>
      <h2 id="note-management">Note Management</h2>
      <p>Since I take my notes in plaintext, I can take advantage of the power of Git to track
      revisions. Each separate class has its own Git repository which I host on Gitlab (I would
      have used Github, but the fact that I can&rsquo;t have infinite private repositories means
      that all of my university&rsquo;s administration would jump down my throat for academic
      dishonesty). This way, I can properly synchronize my repositories between my desktop and
      laptop.</p>
      <h2 id="study-guides">Study Guides</h2>
      <p>This is where my love of Linux (and ancient technologies) rears its ugly head. Generally,
      I want to take all of the notes that I&rsquo;ve taken over the quarter or semester and
      compile them into one document that I can easily read anywhere. I use <code>pandoc</code> to
      convert all of my notes into LaTeX, which I then <code>\input</code> into a container
      document. Then I can compile my document and voila! I have a beautifully typeset (like that
      matters) study guide with all of my notes. I generally format the container to be a tiny bit
      fancier than usual, including a table of contents and multiple chapters.</p>
      <p>Of course, running these commands by hand every time I updated my notes would get quite
      cumbersome. So, looking into the past for inspiration, I landed on another ancient Unix
      utility: <code>make</code>. I always make sure to implement a clean rule and that I use
      wildcards to prevent having to update my makefile with every new note markdown file. I also
      modify my .gitignore so I don&rsquo;t actually include those automatically generated .tex
      files in my version control history.</p>
      <h2 id="advantages">Advantages(?)</h2>
      <p>Any &ldquo;time benefits&rdquo; I get from this system are undoubtedly negated by the time
      it takes to maintain it. It&rsquo;s more about creating a system in which I can use my
      favorite tools (Vim, Git, and the command line) and in which I have total control. Are the
      results better than just biting the bullet and using Microsoft Word or Google Drive? Probably
      not. It would probably be usable from more computers, and the revision history would be just
      as good. But it&rsquo;s more about the principle of being able to take notes in a way
      that&rsquo;s comfortable for me.</p>
