      <p>Dead week has begun. When not in their rooms studying, sleepless students with glazed eyes
      and racing thoughts slowly pace the hallways, eager for a break from relentless business,
      mathematics, and computer science assignments. And throughout all of Kaufmann, young,
      clueless freshmen are crying out, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the fuss about?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m doing something wrong, but the end of my first semester
      seems eerily easy. To be sure, I have a few big tests coming up, some of which count for a
      large percentage of my grade. But for the most part, classes have wound down to a totally
      manageable &ndash; even painless &ndash; level of work. Around me, all of the upperclassmen
      are scrambling to study for final exams, finish up difficult assignments, and still maintain
      some level of sleep (with the exception of Karl, who I suspect isn&rsquo;t human anyway).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, my friends and I have planned out a week-long D&amp;D campaign. Oh, the joys of
      youth.</p>
