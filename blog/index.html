          <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Jekyll to host this website since I&rsquo;ve started it. I
          originally started using it because it&rsquo;s what Github Pages provided, but since I
          wanted to use a custom theme, I had to use several hacks to publish a compiled version of
          my site to the master branch. I&rsquo;ve finally switched to Hugo, since I figured that
          if I was going to have to roll my own publication tools, I might as well use a site
          generator that fit with my mental model.</p><a href=

          <p>On Friday I finished my internship at CBOE. Quite honestly I&rsquo;m going to miss
          working there; I learned a lot, both from my coworkers and from the codebase. In this
          post I&rsquo;m going to go over what I liked (and disliked) about my summer internship.
          The Known Unknowns Going into this internship, I knew that I would have to learn how to
          properly develop software with others. Most of my prior experience involved me writing a
          program to solve a problem or complete an assignment.</p><a href=

          <p>If you know any Linux people, you&rsquo;ll know that many of them seem to have this
          obsession with changing the distribution of their operating system every few months. I am
          one of these people. I guess that after so many months of use, Ubuntu just grew too
          ancient for me. Or something. So now I&rsquo;m running Fedora 28. I have all kinds of
          rationalizations for choosing it: it has a better release cycle that lets me use new
          software sooner, it&rsquo;s more FOSS than Ubuntu, yadda yadda yadda.</p><a href=

          <p>Last week, I started my first internship at Cboe Global Markets. Hooray! I&rsquo;m
          getting paid to do what I do for fun anyway! I was expecting it to be difficult, and it
          is, but it&rsquo;s certainly not as difficult as I was led to believe. Obviously I
          can&rsquo;t talk about anything that I&rsquo;m working on in detail (NDAs and all that),
          but I can say that I&rsquo;m being much more productive than I expected.</p><a href=

          <p>I was re-reading Douglas Adams&rsquo;s Restaraunt at the End of the Universe, and I
          came across one of Adams&rsquo;s many flights of fancy: &ldquo;Disaster Area was a
          plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones and was generally regarded as not only
          the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but also as being the loudest noise of any kind at
          all. Regular concert goers judged that the best sound balance was usually to be heard
          from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles away from the stage, whilst
          the musicians themselves played their instruments by remote control from within a heavily
          insulated spaceship which stayed in orbit around the planet - or more frequently around a
          completely different planet.</p><a href=
