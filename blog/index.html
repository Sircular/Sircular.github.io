          <p>Since it&rsquo;s the new year, it&rsquo;s allegedly a new me, and starting this
          semester, I&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to take a few English classes. I&rsquo;m
          starting with Intro to Fiction writing, and I&rsquo;m thinking of publishing a few of the
          things that I write in that class on here. Although a lot of the coursework is going to
          be composed writing exercises that don&rsquo;t have, y&rsquo;know, plots or character
          development, I do know that I&rsquo;ll be writing a couple short stories at some point
          this semester.</p><a href="/blog/2019/01/creative-writing/">Read More</a>

          <p>I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m finally done with finals. It&rsquo;s been a heck of a
          semester. My classes were&hellip; well, meh, for the most part. Computer Engineering was
          a challenge, as was Computer Science. I didn&rsquo;t do as well as I would like in Linear
          Algebra (retrospectively, I could have, but I slacked off a little too much at the
          beginning of the semester). UNIX was a joke, as everyone told me.</p><a href=

          <p>Please stop using them. Your students will thank you. Since I&rsquo;ve entered
          college, this has been something of a pet peeve of mine. I understand why teachers do it;
          it&rsquo;s a very useful tool for structuring how much a particular group of homework,
          quizzes, or tests affects grades. It&rsquo;s really very predictable when you calculate
          grades at the end of the semester. But when you&rsquo;re checking grades over the course
          of the year, weighted grades can be very frustrating for a student, because new grades
          added to a weighted average system can&rsquo;t affect grades across assignment
          groups.</p><a href="/blog/2018/12/please-stop-using-weighted-grades/">Read More</a>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Jekyll to host this website since I&rsquo;ve started it. I
          originally started using it because it&rsquo;s what Github Pages provided, but since I
          wanted to use a custom theme, I had to use several hacks to publish a compiled version of
          my site to the master branch. I&rsquo;ve finally switched to Hugo, since I figured that
          if I was going to have to roll my own publication tools, I might as well use a site
          generator that fit with my mental model.</p><a href=

          <p>On Friday I finished my internship at CBOE. Quite honestly I&rsquo;m going to miss
          working there; I learned a lot, both from my coworkers and from the codebase. In this
          post I&rsquo;m going to go over what I liked (and disliked) about my summer internship.
          The Known Unknowns Going into this internship, I knew that I would have to learn how to
          properly develop software with others. Most of my prior experience involved me writing a
          program to solve a problem or complete an assignment.</p><a href=
