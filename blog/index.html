            <p>It&rsquo;s June of 2019, and political tensions are at an all-time high. Fear of
            election fraud, either from fears of hacking or double voting, is widespread on all
            political sides. Do you know what this country needs? Another hot take on the
            Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck system. Background I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of
            excellent criticisms leveled at this system. For those of you not familiar with it, the
            Crosscheck system takes voting records from all participating states, then checks for
            any duplicate people.</p><a href=

            <p>Since it&rsquo;s the new year, it&rsquo;s allegedly a new me, and starting this
            semester, I&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to take a few English classes. I&rsquo;m
            starting with Intro to Fiction writing, and I&rsquo;m thinking of publishing a few of
            the things that I write in that class on here. Although a lot of the coursework is
            going to be composed writing exercises that don&rsquo;t have, y&rsquo;know, plots or
            character development, I do know that I&rsquo;ll be writing a couple short stories at
            some point this semester.</p><a href="/blog/2019/01/creative-writing/">Read More</a>

            <p>I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m finally done with finals. It&rsquo;s been a heck of a
            semester. My classes were&hellip; well, meh, for the most part. Computer Engineering
            was a challenge, as was Computer Science. I didn&rsquo;t do as well as I would like in
            Linear Algebra (retrospectively, I could have, but I slacked off a little too much at
            the beginning of the semester). UNIX was a joke, as everyone told me.</p><a href=

            <p>Please stop using them. Your students will thank you. Since I&rsquo;ve entered
            college, this has been something of a pet peeve of mine. I understand why teachers do
            it; it&rsquo;s a very useful tool for structuring how much a particular group of
            homework, quizzes, or tests affects grades. It&rsquo;s really very predictable when you
            calculate grades at the end of the semester. But when you&rsquo;re checking grades over
            the course of the year, weighted grades can be very frustrating for a student, because
            new grades added to a weighted average system can&rsquo;t affect grades across
            assignment groups.</p><a href="/blog/2018/12/please-stop-using-weighted-grades/">Read

            <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Jekyll to host this website since I&rsquo;ve started it. I
            originally started using it because it&rsquo;s what Github Pages provided, but since I
            wanted to use a custom theme, I had to use several hacks to publish a compiled version
            of my site to the master branch. I&rsquo;ve finally switched to Hugo, since I figured
            that if I was going to have to roll my own publication tools, I might as well use a
            site generator that fit with my mental model.</p><a href=
