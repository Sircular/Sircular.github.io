          <p>On Friday I finished my internship at CBOE. Quite honestly I&rsquo;m going to miss
          working there; I learned a lot, both from my coworkers and from the codebase. In this
          post I&rsquo;m going to go over what I liked (and disliked) about my summer internship.
          The Known Unknowns Going into this internship, I knew that I would have to learn how to
          properly develop software with others. Most of my prior experience involved me writing a
          program to solve a problem or complete an assignment.</p><a href=

          <p>If you know any Linux people, you&rsquo;ll know that many of them seem to have this
          obsession with changing the distribution of their operating system every few months. I am
          one of these people. I guess that after so many months of use, Ubuntu just grew too
          ancient for me. Or something. So now I&rsquo;m running Fedora 28. I have all kinds of
          rationalizations for choosing it: it has a better release cycle that lets me use new
          software sooner, it&rsquo;s more FOSS than Ubuntu, yadda yadda yadda.</p><a href=

          <p>Last week, I started my first internship at Cboe Global Markets. Hooray! I&rsquo;m
          getting paid to do what I do for fun anyway! I was expecting it to be difficult, and it
          is, but it&rsquo;s certainly not as difficult as I was led to believe. Obviously I
          can&rsquo;t talk about anything that I&rsquo;m working on in detail (NDAs and all that),
          but I can say that I&rsquo;m being much more productive than I expected.</p><a href=

          <p>I was re-reading Douglas Adams&rsquo;s Restaraunt at the End of the Universe, and I
          came across one of Adams&rsquo;s many flights of fancy: &ldquo;Disaster Area was a
          plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones and was generally regarded as not only
          the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but also as being the loudest noise of any kind at
          all. Regular concert goers judged that the best sound balance was usually to be heard
          from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles away from the stage, whilst
          the musicians themselves played their instruments by remote control from within a heavily
          insulated spaceship which stayed in orbit around the planet - or more frequently around a
          completely different planet.</p><a href=

          <p>I competed in Ludum Dare 41 last weekend, when I made a small video game in 48 hours.
          Was that ever a learning experience. First off, you can play my entry, Puzzle Prizon,
          here! LD 41 is still in its voting rounds, so if you also participated in Ludum Dare,
          I&rsquo;d like to have your feedback. Preparation I&rsquo;ve written about my other
          failed attempts at participating in game jams. Every time that I&rsquo;ve gone to join
          one, life has gotten in the way, whether that be schoolwork or laziness.</p><a href=
