          <p>Please stop using them. Your students will thank you. Since I&rsquo;ve entered
          college, this has been something of a pet peeve of mine. I understand why teachers do it;
          it&rsquo;s a very useful tool for structuring how much a particular group of homework,
          quizzes, or tests affects grades. It&rsquo;s really very predictable when you calculate
          grades at the end of the semester. But when you&rsquo;re checking grades over the course
          of the year, weighted grades can be very frustrating for a student, because new grades
          added to a weighted average system can&rsquo;t affect grades across assignment
          groups.</p><a href="/blog/2018/12/please-stop-using-weighted-grades/">Read More</a>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Jekyll to host this website since I&rsquo;ve started it. I
          originally started using it because it&rsquo;s what Github Pages provided, but since I
          wanted to use a custom theme, I had to use several hacks to publish a compiled version of
          my site to the master branch. I&rsquo;ve finally switched to Hugo, since I figured that
          if I was going to have to roll my own publication tools, I might as well use a site
          generator that fit with my mental model.</p><a href=

          <p>On Friday I finished my internship at CBOE. Quite honestly I&rsquo;m going to miss
          working there; I learned a lot, both from my coworkers and from the codebase. In this
          post I&rsquo;m going to go over what I liked (and disliked) about my summer internship.
          The Known Unknowns Going into this internship, I knew that I would have to learn how to
          properly develop software with others. Most of my prior experience involved me writing a
          program to solve a problem or complete an assignment.</p><a href=

          <p>If you know any Linux people, you&rsquo;ll know that many of them seem to have this
          obsession with changing the distribution of their operating system every few months. I am
          one of these people. I guess that after so many months of use, Ubuntu just grew too
          ancient for me. Or something. So now I&rsquo;m running Fedora 28. I have all kinds of
          rationalizations for choosing it: it has a better release cycle that lets me use new
          software sooner, it&rsquo;s more FOSS than Ubuntu, yadda yadda yadda.</p><a href=

          <p>Last week, I started my first internship at Cboe Global Markets. Hooray! I&rsquo;m
          getting paid to do what I do for fun anyway! I was expecting it to be difficult, and it
          is, but it&rsquo;s certainly not as difficult as I was led to believe. Obviously I
          can&rsquo;t talk about anything that I&rsquo;m working on in detail (NDAs and all that),
          but I can say that I&rsquo;m being much more productive than I expected.</p><a href=
