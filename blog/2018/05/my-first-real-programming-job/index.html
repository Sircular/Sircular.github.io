      <p>Last week, I started my first internship at Cboe Global Markets. Hooray! I&rsquo;m getting
      paid to do what I do for fun anyway!</p>
      <p>I was expecting it to be difficult, and it is, but it&rsquo;s certainly not as difficult
      as I was led to believe. Obviously I can&rsquo;t talk about anything that I&rsquo;m working
      on in detail (NDAs and all that), but I can say that I&rsquo;m being much more productive
      than I expected. Whether that&rsquo;s because I underestimated my own programming skill,
      because the codebase is particularly clean, or because Python is so easy to read and write
      (worth the slow performance IMO), I&rsquo;ve already been making some nontrivial changes to
      code that will go into production in a few weeks. I&rsquo;m not sure whether to be excited or
      terrified.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m enjoying the people that I work with as well. The lights are turned off most of
      the time, and they cater in lunch, so all of us can &ldquo;stay in our little cave&rdquo;
      without having to venture out into the big, scary world.</p>
      <p>I think I&rsquo;m already liking it here.</p>
