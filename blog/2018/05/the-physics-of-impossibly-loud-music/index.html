      <p>I was re-reading Douglas Adams&rsquo;s <em>Restaraunt at the End of the Universe</em>, and
      I came across one of Adams&rsquo;s many flights of fancy:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;Disaster Area was a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones and was
        generally regarded as not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but also as being the
        loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers judged that the best sound balance
        was usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles away
        from the stage, whilst the musicians themselves played their instruments by remote control
        from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stayed in orbit around the planet - or more
        frequently around a completely different planet.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I began to wonder <em>just how loud that actually was</em>; after all, I&rsquo;ve been to
      concerts that made my ears ring for a couple of days, and those were nowhere near as loud. So
      I decided that I would need to do some math to figure this out, because why not.</p>
      <p>In my experience, the &ldquo;best&rdquo; sound balance is approximately in the middle of
      the venue. According to some (slightly sketchy) research, it seems that for open-air venues,
      the speakers are set to approximately 120 dB at the front row (!!!). If we assume that the
      front row is approximately 20 feet away from the speakers, then I would most likely want to
      be approximately 225 feet away from the speakers. Additionally, since decibels are a
      logarithmic scale, every doubling of distance reduces the volume by 6 dB. This yields an
      equation for &ldquo;best sound balance&rdquo;:</p>
      <p>$$ 120\text{dB} - \left[6 \times \log_2\left(\frac{225}{20}\right)\right] \approx
      99.049\text{dB} $$</p>
      <p>So that&rsquo;s the goal volume for our impossibly loud concert. We also need to account
      for the &ldquo;concrete bunker&rdquo; part. The noise isolation of construction materials is
      defined by a given material&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sound Transmission Class&rdquo; (STC). As best I
      can tell, STC corresponds pretty closely with dB reduction (although high frequencies are
      generally muted more successfully than low frequencies). A solid, 8-in. thick wall of
      concrete seems to have an STC rating of ~54. Therefore, to reach ~99dB inside the bunker, the
      volume would need to be ~153dB immediately outside the bunker. That is some serious
      volume.</p>
      <p>We also need to account for the attenuation of distance. Given that the hypothetical
      bunker is ~37 miles from the stage, we can calculate the required decibels:</p>
      <p>$$ 153.049\text{dB} + \left[6 \times \log_2\left(\frac{37 \times 5280}{225}\right)\right]
      \approx 211.621\text{dB} $$</p>
      <p><em>Good Lord.</em> That&rsquo;s a lot of volume. For context, the highest chart that I
      could find only goes up to 150dB, which is the threshold for eardrum rupture. This concert is
      about 1234.885 times as loud as a <em>jet take-off at 25m.</em> When I converted this value
      into air pressure, it clocks in at <em>over 7 atmospheres.</em></p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s a lot of power.</p>
