      <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with game development for several years now. I&rsquo;ve researched
      engines and frameworks, looked into drawing, level design, and music programs, and thrown
      around ideas. I even started programming a few of them. Guess how many I&rsquo;ve
      finished.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m not the only one with this problem. Most &ldquo;game developers&rdquo; never
      really get much farther than a working prototype of a few of their core mechanics. While that
      can be fun &mdash; if you call fiddling with weights until the movement doesn&rsquo;t seem to
      floaty or heavy &ldquo;fun&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s not as fulfilling as (I imagine)
      completing a game would be.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join a game jam! That&rsquo;ll give me
      enough motivation.&rdquo; Alas, it was not to be. Until college, I never really had the time
      to put in an entire weekend for a game jam &ndash; not when I had to get to school by 7am the
      following Monday. And Ludum Dare, one of the most popular game jams, never fell during the
      summer.</p>
      <p>Even so, I tried to join two while still in high school. Both times I took a look at the
      theme, thought and occasionally typed for an hour, and gave up. I blamed this on not having
      the right software, the right graphics, the right engine &mdash; but really I knew that I
      needed to grit my teeth and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7524jhl.gif">just do it.</a></p>
      <p>So when I came across a game jam for the month of January, I thought &ldquo;perfect.
      I&rsquo;ll be able to start on this at the end of winter break, so I&rsquo;ll have the
      motivation to keep going during the school year.&rdquo; I put my name on the mailing list and
      sat back contentedly.</p>
      <p>Except none of that ever happened. I still haven&rsquo;t started, and I&rsquo;ve all but
      forgotten that I entered in the first place. I don&rsquo;t intend on entering a
      submission.</p>
      <p>That said, I still want this to happen. I still want to be able to say &ldquo;yes, I made
      a game.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t care how small it is, I just want to make it, complete it, and
      share it.</p>
      <p>So for all of those who know a) me and b) a bit of programming, let me know if
      you&rsquo;re interested in a collaboration at some time when schedules aren&rsquo;t hell. And
      for every other game programmer looking for inspiration to finally get themselves over the
      hump: me too.</p>
