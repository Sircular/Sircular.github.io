      <p>Good news everyone! I finished my first session as a GM, and I didn&rsquo;t die!
      I&rsquo;ve found a few strengths and many weaknesses, but I at least have some idea
      what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
      <h2 id="the-preparation">The Preparation</h2>
      <p>I have a couple of close friends who have been GMs before. Neither of them has tons and
      tons of experience, but they have a good idea of what they&rsquo;re doing. They recommended
      that I watch all of Matt Colville&rsquo;s <a href=
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-YZvLUXcR8&amp;list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_">Running
      the Game</a> series. I got a few episodes in, and he gives tons and <em>tons</em> of good
      advice. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to someone who wants to learn how to run a
      role-playing game.</p>
      <p>That said, I got the most experience when I actually took the plunge.</p>
      <h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m a decent storyteller! I can use voices! Those two should make me a great GM on
      their own, right?</p>
      <p>Well, not really, but they do help.</p>
      <p>I wasn&rsquo;t completely lost when I was running different encounters. Other than the
      fact that I didn&rsquo;t know what a reasonable cost was, nor what reasonable abilities for
      my NPCs were, I could keep track of the interactions fairly well. It also helped that I had
      made a roadmap of the session ahead of time. If my players had strayed too far from that,
      well&hellip; I might not be quite so chipper in this post.</p>
      <h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
      <p>My main weakness is that I don&rsquo;t know the rules of D&amp;D very well. I really
      should, since it&rsquo;s my job to know the rules of the game that I&rsquo;m in charge of,
      but, well&hellip; rules are hard. I didn&rsquo;t decide to GM because I wanted to <em>follow
      rules.</em> I became a GM because I wanted to <em>tell stories.</em></p>
      <p>Story might have to take a backseat for a while until I really figure out how to follow
      the rules though.</p>
      <h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
      <p>Combat was downright awful. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. I don&rsquo;t know how to run
      a combative encounter well.</p>
      <p>Part of it was that I used stock monsters, and those don&rsquo;t tend to deal well with
      5th level player characters. They didn&rsquo;t have good weapons nor good strategies. I
      wasn&rsquo;t able to play them creatively, so the battle encounters (one of which went on for
      an hour) just felt like a long grind.</p>
      <p>This comes from not knowing the monsters, not knowing the rules, and not knowing enough
      about the tropes that are familiar with regular D&amp;D players.</p>
      <h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m not a good DM. I&rsquo;m <em>okay</em>, but not great. But that&rsquo;s fine.
      Practice makes perfect.</p>
      <p>Or so I&rsquo;ve been told.</p>
