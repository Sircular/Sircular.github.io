      <p>I&rsquo;m going to start being a Game Master for a D&amp;D game on Friday. I have no idea
      what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s not exactly true. I&rsquo;ve got a world that a friend built, I&rsquo;ve got
      a few ideas going in, and I&rsquo;ve got some generators I can use. But going into something
      like this with exactly zero experience is always going to be nerve-wracking.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve never run an encounter. I&rsquo;ve never run a battle. I&rsquo;ve never played
      NPCs.</p>
      <p>All I can really do is voices. That&rsquo;s entirely the extent of the experience that I
      have with GM skills.</p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s not to say I won&rsquo;t have a lot of fun. I&rsquo;ve been playing with this
      group since the beginning of the semester, and our campaign has been an absolute blast. One
      of the players in my campaign is the GM of our main campaign, so he&rsquo;s been giving me
      pointers along and along.</p>
      <p>But I&rsquo;ve still never done this before. It will be interesting.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;ll deliver a full report after my first session as a GM. I hope that someone gets
      something out of it. Or not. That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
