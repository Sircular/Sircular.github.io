      <p>It&rsquo;s official: I&rsquo;ve shelled out for a domain name, waltermays.com, and pointed
      it to this very blog. Amazing!</p>
      <p>I waited a long time to do this, since a) I didn&rsquo;t have a reason and b) that&rsquo;s
      money I didn&rsquo;t necessarily <em>need</em> to spend. But I think this is well worth it. I
      actually have something I can put on my resume, plus I get to say I have my own website.</p>
      <p>Well, everyone now has their own website. But still.</p>
      <p>My only complaint with the experience is that Google should make it easier to point your
      domain to a server, rather than just redirecting your browser. But then again, what do I
      know.</p>
