      <p>I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m finally done with finals. It&rsquo;s been a heck of a
      semester.</p>
      <p>My classes were&hellip; well, meh, for the most part. Computer Engineering was a
      challenge, as was Computer Science. I didn&rsquo;t do as well as I would like in Linear
      Algebra (retrospectively, I could have, but I slacked off a little too much at the beginning
      of the semester). UNIX was a joke, as everyone told me.</p>
      <p>Finance and Statistics. Those are <em>finally</em> over.</p>
      <p>I suppose that I can&rsquo;t blame my professor for those problems. He was doing the best
      that he could, since he had to throw together some lesson plans quickly. But I still think
      that an introductory statistics class <em>should not be taught in R</em>. I don&rsquo;t think
      it&rsquo;s a bad language, but relying on a computer that much for every step of the process
      makes it difficult for people to learn the underlying material. There&rsquo;s a reason that
      so much of most mathematical topics (heck, even computer science!) is taught on paper with
      language-agnostic rules: you don&rsquo;t become so reliant on those languages when
      they&rsquo;re not there for you.</p>
      <p>Also yeah, Finance (pronounced <em>Fin-ants</em>) was taught largely in R as well. I
      understand why, but well&hellip; I&rsquo;m still not a huge fan.</p>
      <p>But it&rsquo;s over! It&rsquo;s finally over. Well, at least until next semester.</p>
