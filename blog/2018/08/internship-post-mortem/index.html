      <p>On Friday I finished my internship at CBOE. Quite honestly I&rsquo;m going to miss working
      there; I learned a lot, both from my coworkers and from the codebase. In this post I&rsquo;m
      going to go over what I liked (and disliked) about my summer internship.</p>
      <h2 id="the-known-unknowns">The Known Unknowns</h2>
      <p>Going into this internship, I knew that I would have to learn how to properly develop
      software with others. Most of my prior experience involved me writing a program to solve a
      problem or complete an assignment. Once I was done with the code, it was finished, and rarely
      would I make any further changes. This experience was fine as far as it went, but I knew it
      wouldn&rsquo;t scale.</p>
      <p>Going into my internship, I knew that I would have to learn how to effectively use version
      control; how to effectively compromise my own ideas and style with precedents set by others;
      and most importantly, how to read others&rsquo; code. I knew that code written in a large
      codebase was written first and foremost with other programmers in mind. In my own personal
      projects, it didn&rsquo;t matter how many cool tricks I used, but in a large codebase,
      readability and clarity trumps all else.</p>
      <p>I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed on this front. Although CBOE does version control a little
      differently than some other companies, I found it relatively straightforward to merge in my
      changes. It certainly helped that most of my projects involved code that others weren&rsquo;t
      using, so merge conflicts weren&rsquo;t a concern.</p>
      <p>I didn&rsquo;t really understand how important unit and integration tests were until I had
      to work with code that leveraged them (or didn&rsquo;t). Code with tests is so much easier to
      understand, because there are examples of desired behavior. It&rsquo;s also more fun to poke
      around in, because you can rest assured that good tests will tell you if you&rsquo;ve broken
      from desired behavior. These experiences spoiled me; I can&rsquo;t go back to reading code
      without tests (although that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I now enjoy writing them).</p>
      <p>I learned that a lot of constructs that I use often (such as generators in Python) can be
      very inconvenient for people that aren&rsquo;t used to working with them. Even though there
      were a few places where I think a generator (or a similarly high-level construct) would have
      been a perfect fit, I now had to think about consistency with the rest of the codebase.</p>
      <p>And the reading. <em>My God, the reading.</em> Working with my own code, or even
      occasionally with others&rsquo; code, I would generally read about three lines for every line
      that I wrote. At CBOE, that ratio was closer to 20:1. Several of my projects involved
      modifying or improving existing code, so I needed to read the code (and often underlying API
      and framework code) in its entirety to properly understand my task, let alone its
      implementation. Even my &ldquo;green field&rdquo; projects still had to conform to and
      interact with the rest of the codebase.</p>
      <p>While I did expect to learn all these lessons, there were several other lessons that came
      as a surprise.</p>
      <h2 id="the-unknown-unknowns">The Unknown Unknowns</h2>
      <p>As with all new experiences, there were some aspects of this internship I didn&rsquo;t
      anticipate. Most of them were software-development-related, but a few had more to do with,
      for lack of a better phrase, workplace conduct. I&rsquo;m sure none of these are very
      surprising to people that have worked in industry, but they were eye-openers for me.</p>
      <p>I thought that I knew design patterns. How wrong I was. I had a vague grasp of many of the
      <a href=
      "https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8&gt;"
      title="Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software">Gang of Four&rsquo;s
      Design Patterns</a>, but knowledge and application are sometimes very different. Furthermore,
      I learned that paradigms can be considered (large) design patterns, and that some paradigms
      are better-suited to certain problems than others. I&rsquo;m sure this one comes down to
      personal experience; I learned to program in Java, and even when I moved to Python and other
      languages I maintained an object-oriented approach. However, for some of my projects, a
      procedural style was clearer. I didn&rsquo;t realize this until one of my coworkers pointed
      it out in a code review, when I rewrote my code to be more procedural, it was simpler,
      clearer, and shorter.</p>
      <p>I also thought that I had a fairly good idea of my role as &ldquo;just an intern&rdquo;:
      fix bugs, write some small scripts, and do as much learning as possible. That was very far
      from the truth. The software development part of CBOE, while it does have a defined
      hierarchy, is very free-form as far as decision-making is concerned. Even as a lowly intern,
      I had final say over the implementation details of my code. I was expected to know when I had
      chosen rightly or wrongly, even if the person doing my code review disagreed. I was
      pleasantly surprised; I had expected CBOE to be far more bureaucratic than it was.</p>
      <h2 id="intern-ly-duties">Intern-ly Duties</h2>
      <p><em>This section is very subjective, so please take it with a grain of salt.</em></p>
      <p>No job is perfect. No internship is perfect either. There were several negative aspects of
      my internship at CBOE, but almost all of them were centered around the fact that I was an
      intern. My weekly schedule involved any number of classes, icebreakers, and occasional
      presentations. I think that these have value, but I also think that I would have gotten more
      out of the internship if I had more time to do real work.</p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; the classes were useful. Although I didn&rsquo;t go into this
      internship with a rabid curiosity of the stock and options market, I came away with a better
      appreciation of the financial world. They were even more valuable as context for the problems
      I was solving.</p>
      <p>The icebreakers and presentations on the other hand&hellip; were less valuable for me. I
      understand the value of presentations, but I don&rsquo;t understand why it&rsquo;s necessary
      to fly all the Kansas City interns out to Chicago to give them in front of high-level
      executives. The Chicago trip, while very useful for some of the other interns, was
      unproductive for me. This may be the solitary, brooding programmer in me, but I&rsquo;d
      rather discuss ideas than try to network.</p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Given the choice, I would do this internship all over again. I worked with fantastic
      people, both managers and coworkers, that taught me more than I thought I could learn in a
      summer. I got to solve interesting problems, and learned a lot about computer science in the
      industry as opposed to academia. Even though I didn&rsquo;t enjoy many of the intern-specific
      aspects, I still found the overall experience worthwhile.</p>
      <p>Would I recommend this internship for someone else? Absolutely. If you want to solve hard
      problems and work with good people (and who among us doesn&rsquo;t), CBOE will offer you that
      opportunity.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m not going back next summer, but not because I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it; I just want
      to get more experience working with different types of companies. I have a hunch that CBOE
      will rank highly among them.</p>
