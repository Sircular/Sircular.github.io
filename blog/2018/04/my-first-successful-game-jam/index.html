      <p>I competed in Ludum Dare 41 last weekend, when I made a small video game in 48 hours. Was
      that ever a learning experience.</p>
      <p>First off, you can play my entry, <a href=
      "https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/puzzle-prizon">Puzzle Prizon, here</a>! LD 41 is
      still in its voting rounds, so if you also participated in Ludum Dare, I&rsquo;d like to have
      your feedback.</p>
      <h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
      <p><a href="/blog/2018/01/23/my-third-failed-jam/">I&rsquo;ve written about my other failed
      attempts at participating in game jams.</a> Every time that I&rsquo;ve gone to join one, life
      has gotten in the way, whether that be schoolwork or laziness. This time though, the stars
      aligned. It was a weekend before dead week, so I didn&rsquo;t need to worry about projects or
      assignments, nor did I need to really double down on my study sessions.</p>
      <p>So I watched Ludum Dare timelapses, where people demonstrate their system for developing a
      game. I especially liked watching the videos of <a href=
      "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMFVcnkIM5L4V8fA24C51g">Pixel Prophecy</a>, since he
      always makes his videos so engaging. I blocked out a schedule and let my friends know that I
      would be disappearing for a week. I wrote some small tech demos as warmups to actually
      competing. I religiously checked the Ludum Dare website to see when theme voting would
      start.</p>
      <h3 id="a-note-on-themes">A Note on Themes</h3>
      <p>Everyone (including me) likes to complain about the Ludum Dare themes, and this year is no
      exception. After the final rounds of voting, the chosen theme was &ldquo;Combine Two
      Incompatible Genres.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><em>Bleh.</em></p>
      <p>I particularly hate this theme. Rather than talking about topics or ideas that can be
      discussed, it instead focuses on mechanics and process. My personal opinion is that if you
      want to really let people work in the incredibly varied video game genres (top-down,
      platformer, FPS, text-based games), then you really need to allow it to be open. I got into a
      couple of small debates about this; other people think that themes should inherently be
      difficult to work with, forcing designers to think outside the box of the theme. I still
      think that this is the wrong kind of restriction to impose on people, but to each their
      own.</p>
      <h2 id="the-competition">The Competition</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie: creating a video game in 48 hours is stressful. I barely left
      my room during that time except to eat and take the occasional exercise break. The one maxim
      of video game development is that <em>you will run out of time</em>, and I certainly found
      that to be the case. At the beginning of the competition, I had all these ideas for complex
      mechanics and puzzles that I eventually left on the cutting room floor.</p>
      <p>In order to really make a good game, you have to come up with some good ideas and
      mechanics right off the bad. Game design is an entire career apart from programming and art,
      so I knew that my ideas this time around may be less than stellar. I was right. My chosen
      genres &ndash; stealth games and puzzle games &ndash; were really quite similar, and so I had
      to shoehorn them into this theme.</p>
      <p>As my freshman computer science teacher said, &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out.&rdquo;
      Without a really solid idea, my work stagnated, and I found myself struggling to think of
      puzzling mechanics I would reasonably be able to implement. The ones I settled on are kind of
      half-baked, so I struggled to find ways to make the game more fun. It eventually worked in
      the end; I&rsquo;ve gotten several decent reviews on my game so far. But I still think that
      adding a little more thought into the game at the beginning would have paid me ample
      returns.</p>
      <h3 id="using-restrictions">Using Restrictions</h3>
      <p>When you go to make a game, it can be anything. <em>Anything.</em> Unless you already have
      a firm idea of what you want, this vast emptiness can lead to paralysis of choice. When you
      impose restrictions on yourself, you cut off some options you might otherwise consider.
      Writers are very familiar with this: it&rsquo;s much easier to write something under
      restrictions than something that can be &ldquo;anything you like.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>There&rsquo;s another good reason to use restrictions: to make a good game, one has to be
      good at everything. A good game has good graphics, good music, good sound,
      &ldquo;feels&rdquo; good, is playable, is well-designed, has good controls, etc. No one
      person can do this well on their own in 48 hours. It&rsquo;s just not possible.</p>
      <p>Well, it is. It just depends on your definition of &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>When playing a lot of LD games, you&rsquo;ll find that a large number of them use pixel
      art, and that many games that include music involve classic video game instruments. My game
      is among these. That&rsquo;s because when you&rsquo;re working in something that&rsquo;s
      restricted in these ways, it&rsquo;s much easier to make something decent. I&rsquo;m not a
      good enough graphic artist to do proper character designs on a high-resolution canvas;
      instead, I just made all of my sprites 16x16 pixels and called it good. Likewise, when I
      already had 8-bit samples lying around, I didn&rsquo;t have to figure out how to make a
      saxophone sound realistic. I just put in notes and durations and call it good.</p>
      <p>Lots of other games make things restricted in other ways. For example, some games use
      minimalistic graphics and gameplay, since these are much easier to craft than games with lots
      of mechanics and control schemes.</p>
      <h3 id="the-danger-of-polishing">The Danger of Polishing</h3>
      <p>I spent way too much time on graphics that ultimately didn&rsquo;t even get used. I think
      that I spent about 2-3 hours on the player character and guards, which went through several
      revisions. That&rsquo;s time I could have spend implementing core mechanics, so that when
      crunch time came, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to put in a relatively bare-bones puzzle system.</p>
      <p>By focusing too much on one aspect of a game, the other aspects get neglected. There are
      only so many hours available, and budgeting time effectively is paramount for getting
      something that&rsquo;s playable <em>at all</em>. I scraped by, but just in the nick of
      time.</p>
      <h2 id="the-end-result">The End Result</h2>
      <p>Overall, I&rsquo;m happy with my game. It&rsquo;s not perfect, and it&rsquo;s not really
      what I expected it to be, but it&rsquo;s a project that I started and finished and is
      (mostly) playable. I can show this to people and say &ldquo;I made this.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>And that&rsquo;s enough reason to be proud in itself.</p>
