    <p>I&rsquo;m going to start being a Game Master for a D&amp;D game on Friday. I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing.
That&rsquo;s not exactly true. I&rsquo;ve got a world that a friend built, I&rsquo;ve got a few ideas going in, and I&rsquo;ve got some generators I can use. But going into something like this with exactly zero experience is always going to be nerve-wracking.
I&rsquo;ve never run an encounter. I&rsquo;ve never run a battle.</p>

    <p>Those of you who have been following my blog know that I posted something called &ldquo;The End Is Nigh,&rdquo; in which I disparaged those who felt overwhelmed by school. Oh how the turntables&hellip; All it took was a good dose of too many credit hours.
I was doing a healthy 15 credit hours last semester; this semester it&rsquo;s up to 19. That isn&rsquo;t to say I&rsquo;m not enjoying it. I&rsquo;m not, but that&rsquo;s not why.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s official: I&rsquo;ve shelled out for a domain name, waltermays.com, and pointed it to this very blog. Amazing!
I waited a long time to do this, since a) I didn&rsquo;t have a reason and b) that&rsquo;s money I didn&rsquo;t necessarily need to spend. But I think this is well worth it. I actually have something I can put on my resume, plus I get to say I have my own website.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with game development for several years now. I&rsquo;ve researched engines and frameworks, looked into drawing, level design, and music programs, and thrown around ideas. I even started programming a few of them. Guess how many I&rsquo;ve finished.
I&rsquo;m not the only one with this problem. Most &ldquo;game developers&rdquo; never really get much farther than a working prototype of a few of their core mechanics. While that can be fun &mdash; if you call fiddling with weights until the movement doesn&rsquo;t seem to floaty or heavy &ldquo;fun&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s not as fulfilling as (I imagine) completing a game would be.</p>

    <p>This is one of several posts in my "Learn You Some Linux For Great Good" series.  Part 0: A Word of Caution Part 1: Installation Part 2: Getting Comfortable Part 3: Command Line Syntax  So, you&rsquo;ve decided to forge ahead. In this part we will discuss some important jargon to know, look at some distributions (and discuss how to tell them apart), create installation media, and install Linux.</p>
