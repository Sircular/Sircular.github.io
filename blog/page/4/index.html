          <p>It&rsquo;s official: I&rsquo;ve shelled out for a domain name, waltermays.com, and
          pointed it to this very blog. Amazing! I waited a long time to do this, since a) I
          didn&rsquo;t have a reason and b) that&rsquo;s money I didn&rsquo;t necessarily need to
          spend. But I think this is well worth it. I actually have something I can put on my
          resume, plus I get to say I have my own website.</p><a href=

          <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with game development for several years now. I&rsquo;ve
          researched engines and frameworks, looked into drawing, level design, and music programs,
          and thrown around ideas. I even started programming a few of them. Guess how many
          I&rsquo;ve finished. I&rsquo;m not the only one with this problem. Most &ldquo;game
          developers&rdquo; never really get much farther than a working prototype of a few of
          their core mechanics. While that can be fun &mdash; if you call fiddling with weights
          until the movement doesn&rsquo;t seem to floaty or heavy &ldquo;fun&rdquo; &mdash;
          it&rsquo;s not as fulfilling as (I imagine) completing a game would be.</p><a href=

          <p>Something has possessed me to learn Haskell. I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly, but it
          must be an evil, illogical demon, since none of my courses nor my possible internships
          use Haskell. Additionally, I am convinced that Haskell programmers have an IQ of at least
          170 (which I most certainly do not have), so it&rsquo;s probably an impossible task.
          Nonetheless, I shall soldier on. My first thought was to attempt to port a working
          program to Haskell.</p><a href="/blog/2017/12/adventures-in-haskell/">Read More</a>
