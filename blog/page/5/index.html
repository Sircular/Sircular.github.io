    <p>Something has possessed me to learn Haskell. I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly, but it must be an evil, illogical demon, since none of my courses nor my possible internships use Haskell. Additionally, I am convinced that Haskell programmers have an IQ of at least 170 (which I most certainly do not have), so it&rsquo;s probably an impossible task. Nonetheless, I shall soldier on.
My first thought was to attempt to port a working program to Haskell.</p>

    <p>This is one of several posts in my "Learn You Some Linux For Great Good" series.  Part 0: A Word of Caution Part 1: Installation Part 2: Getting Comfortable Part 3: Command Line Syntax  Here be dragons. The Linux world is fraught with pitfalls, gotchas, and undocumented quagmires through which even the most seasoned Linux guru struggle to wade. Using Linux can be productive, but it can also lead to many late nights, many lost files, and many outbursts of frustration.</p>

    <p>Dead week has begun. When not in their rooms studying, sleepless students with glazed eyes and racing thoughts slowly pace the hallways, eager for a break from relentless business, mathematics, and computer science assignments. And throughout all of Kaufmann, young, clueless freshmen are crying out, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the fuss about?&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m doing something wrong, but the end of my first semester seems eerily easy. To be sure, I have a few big tests coming up, some of which count for a large percentage of my grade.</p>

    <p>Without going into too much detail, let&rsquo;s just say that I enjoy messing with my workflow far too much. I&rsquo;m constantly trying to get a more efficient setup, a faster, newer, better, shinier plugin, and a more robust tool to use. I have an addiction for configuration. However, for the past few months, I&rsquo;ve found a workflow that works pretty consistently for me.
Note-Taking I take all of my notes in Vim.</p>
