          syntax of the command line. If you already understand how the shell breaks up arguments,
          and the concepts of flags, pipes, and redirections, then skip ahead to the next

          Line Syntax Once you&rsquo;ve finished installation, your computer should ask you to
          restart. If it doesn&rsquo;t, do it anyway. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re just dying to
          test out your new installation of Linux. Baby Steps When you reboot, you should see a

          <p>For those of you who see me every day (or, in the case of my parents, had to deal with
          this mess), you already know the story. For everyone else: I got in a car accident on
          February 13th. It was the stupidest accident I&rsquo;ve ever heard of. I wasn&rsquo;t
          hurt, and the other drivers weren&rsquo;t hurt. It was about as fortunate as an accident
          like this can be. First off, some backstory: I noticed a few days earlier that my wheel
          was wobbling somewhat when I drove.</p><a href="/blog/2018/03/my-stupid-accident/">Read

          <p>Good news everyone! I finished my first session as a GM, and I didn&rsquo;t die!
          I&rsquo;ve found a few strengths and many weaknesses, but I at least have some idea
          what&rsquo;s going on. The Preparation I have a couple of close friends who have been GMs
          before. Neither of them has tons and tons of experience, but they have a good idea of
          what they&rsquo;re doing. They recommended that I watch all of Matt Colville&rsquo;s
          Running the Game series.</p><a href="/blog/2018/02/the-aftermath/">Read More</a>

          <p>I&rsquo;m going to start being a Game Master for a D&amp;D game on Friday. I have no
          idea what I&rsquo;m doing. That&rsquo;s not exactly true. I&rsquo;ve got a world that a
          friend built, I&rsquo;ve got a few ideas going in, and I&rsquo;ve got some generators I
          can use. But going into something like this with exactly zero experience is always going
          to be nerve-wracking. I&rsquo;ve never run an encounter. I&rsquo;ve never run a
