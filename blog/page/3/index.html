            <p>I competed in Ludum Dare 41 last weekend, when I made a small video game in 48
            hours. Was that ever a learning experience. First off, you can play my entry, Puzzle
            Prizon, here! LD 41 is still in its voting rounds, so if you also participated in Ludum
            Dare, I&rsquo;d like to have your feedback. Preparation I&rsquo;ve written about my
            other failed attempts at participating in game jams. Every time that I&rsquo;ve gone to
            join one, life has gotten in the way, whether that be schoolwork or
            laziness.</p><a href="/blog/2018/04/my-first-successful-game-jam/">Read More</a>

            <p>This may come as a shock to you: I, Walter Mays, the ardent LaTeX fanatic, am not
            going to use LaTeX for every assignment anymore. What is this world coming to?!
            It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m going to stop using LaTeX completely. I think that is a
            fantastic system for typesetting structured documents, and I&rsquo;ve been having to
            put together several of those this semester. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade the power of LaTex
            for the world.</p><a href="/blog/2018/03/why-im-moving-away-from-latex/">Read More</a>

            Command Line Syntax To fully understand the command line, you need to have a good grasp
            of the syntax of the command line. If you already understand how the shell breaks up
            arguments, and the concepts of flags, pipes, and redirections, then skip ahead to the
            next part.</p><a href=

            Command Line Syntax Once you&rsquo;ve finished installation, your computer should ask
            you to restart. If it doesn&rsquo;t, do it anyway. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re just
            dying to test out your new installation of Linux. Baby Steps When you reboot, you
            should see a menu pop up.</p><a href=

            <p>For those of you who see me every day (or, in the case of my parents, had to deal
            with this mess), you already know the story. For everyone else: I got in a car accident
            on February 13th. It was the stupidest accident I&rsquo;ve ever heard of. I
            wasn&rsquo;t hurt, and the other drivers weren&rsquo;t hurt. It was about as fortunate
            as an accident like this can be. First off, some backstory: I noticed a few days
            earlier that my wheel was wobbling somewhat when I drove.</p><a href=
