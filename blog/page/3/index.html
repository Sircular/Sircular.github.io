          <p>Good news everyone! I finished my first session as a GM, and I didn&rsquo;t die!
          I&rsquo;ve found a few strengths and many weaknesses, but I at least have some idea
          what&rsquo;s going on. The Preparation I have a couple of close friends who have been GMs
          before. Neither of them has tons and tons of experience, but they have a good idea of
          what they&rsquo;re doing. They recommended that I watch all of Matt Colville&rsquo;s
          Running the Game series.</p><a href="/blog/2018/02/the-aftermath/">Read More</a>

          <p>I&rsquo;m going to start being a Game Master for a D&amp;D game on Friday. I have no
          idea what I&rsquo;m doing. That&rsquo;s not exactly true. I&rsquo;ve got a world that a
          friend built, I&rsquo;ve got a few ideas going in, and I&rsquo;ve got some generators I
          can use. But going into something like this with exactly zero experience is always going
          to be nerve-wracking. I&rsquo;ve never run an encounter. I&rsquo;ve never run a
          battle.</p><a href="/blog/2018/02/im-absolutely-terrified/">Read More</a>

          <p>Those of you who have been following my blog know that I posted something called
          &ldquo;The End Is Nigh,&rdquo; in which I disparaged those who felt overwhelmed by
          school. Oh how the turntables&hellip; All it took was a good dose of too many credit
          hours. I was doing a healthy 15 credit hours last semester; this semester it&rsquo;s up
          to 19. That isn&rsquo;t to say I&rsquo;m not enjoying it. I&rsquo;m not, but that&rsquo;s
          not why.</p><a href="/blog/2018/02/woah.-i-understand-now/">Read More</a>

          <p>It&rsquo;s official: I&rsquo;ve shelled out for a domain name, waltermays.com, and
          pointed it to this very blog. Amazing! I waited a long time to do this, since a) I
          didn&rsquo;t have a reason and b) that&rsquo;s money I didn&rsquo;t necessarily need to
          spend. But I think this is well worth it. I actually have something I can put on my
          resume, plus I get to say I have my own website.</p><a href=

          <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with game development for several years now. I&rsquo;ve
          researched engines and frameworks, looked into drawing, level design, and music programs,
          and thrown around ideas. I even started programming a few of them. Guess how many
          I&rsquo;ve finished. I&rsquo;m not the only one with this problem. Most &ldquo;game
          developers&rdquo; never really get much farther than a working prototype of a few of
          their core mechanics. While that can be fun &mdash; if you call fiddling with weights
          until the movement doesn&rsquo;t seem to floaty or heavy &ldquo;fun&rdquo; &mdash;
          it&rsquo;s not as fulfilling as (I imagine) completing a game would be.</p><a href=
