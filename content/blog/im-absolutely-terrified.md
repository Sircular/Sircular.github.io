I'm going to start being a Game Master for a D&D game on Friday.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

That's not exactly true.
I've got a world that a friend built, I've got a few ideas going in, and I've got some generators I can use.
But going into something like this with exactly zero experience is always going to be nerve-wracking.

I've never run an encounter.
I've never run a battle.
I've never played NPCs.

All I can really do is voices.
That's entirely the extent of the experience that I have with GM skills.

That's not to say I won't have a lot of fun.
I've been playing with this group since the beginning of the semester, and our campaign has been an absolute blast.
One of the players in my campaign is the GM of our main campaign, so he's been giving me pointers along and along.

But I've still never done this before.
It will be interesting.

I'll deliver a full report after my first session as a GM.
I hope that someone gets something out of it.
Or not.
That's fine.
