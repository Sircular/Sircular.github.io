Since it's the new year, it's *allegedly* a new me, and starting this semester,
I'll have the opportunity to take a few English classes.  I'm starting with
Intro to Fiction writing, and I'm thinking of publishing a few of the things
that I write in that class on here.  Although a lot of the coursework is going
to be composed writing exercises that don't have, y'know, plots or character
development, I do know that I'll be writing a couple short stories at some point
this semester.  So if you're interested in reading them, I'll probably make a
new section on my website for those.

Oh also, Happy New Year.  Maybe I should have posted about that.
