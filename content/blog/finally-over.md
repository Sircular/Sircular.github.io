I'm done.  I'm finally done with finals.  It's been a heck of a semester.

My classes were... well, meh, for the most part.  Computer Engineering was a
challenge, as was Computer Science.  I didn't do as well as I would like in
Linear Algebra (retrospectively, I could have, but I slacked off a little too
much at the beginning of the semester).  UNIX was a joke, as everyone told me.

Finance and Statistics.  Those are *finally* over.

I suppose that I can't blame my professor for those problems.  He was doing the
best that he could, since he had to throw together some lesson plans quickly.
But I still think that an introductory statistics class *should not be taught in
R*.  I don't think it's a bad language, but relying on a computer that much for
every step of the process makes it difficult for people to learn the underlying
material.  There's a reason that so much of most mathematical topics (heck, even
computer science!) is taught on paper with language-agnostic rules: you don't
become so reliant on those languages when they're not there for you.

Also yeah, Finance (pronounced *Fin-ants*) was taught largely in R as well.  I
understand why, but well... I'm still not a huge fan.

But it's over!  It's finally over.  Well, at least until next semester.
