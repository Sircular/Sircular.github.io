title: New Domain!

It's official: I've shelled out for a domain name, waltermays.com, and pointed it to this very blog. Amazing!

I waited a long time to do this, since a) I didn't have a reason and b) that's money I didn't necessarily *need* to spend.
But I think this is well worth it.
I actually have something I can put on my resume, plus I get to say I have my own website.

Well, everyone now has their own website.
But still.

My only complaint with the experience is that Google should make it easier to point your domain to a server, rather than just redirecting your browser.
But then again, what do I know.
