Good news everyone!
I finished my first session as a GM, and I didn't die!
I've found a few strengths and many weaknesses, but I at least have some idea what's going on.

## The Preparation

I have a couple of close friends who have been GMs before.
Neither of them has tons and tons of experience, but they have a good idea of what they're doing.
They recommended that I watch all of Matt Colville's [Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-YZvLUXcR8&list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_) series.
I got a few episodes in, and he gives tons and *tons* of good advice.
I would wholeheartedly recommend it to someone who wants to learn how to run a role-playing game.

That said, I got the most experience when I actually took the plunge.

## The Good

I'm a decent storyteller!
I can use voices!
Those two should make me a great GM on their own, right?

Well, not really, but they do help.

I wasn't completely lost when I was running different encounters.
Other than the fact that I didn't know what a reasonable cost was, nor what reasonable abilities for my NPCs were, I could keep track of the interactions fairly well.
It also helped that I had made a roadmap of the session ahead of time.
If my players had strayed too far from that, well... I might not be quite so chipper in this post.

## The Bad

My main weakness is that I don't know the rules of D&D very well.
I really should, since it's my job to know the rules of the game that I'm in charge of, but, well... rules are hard.
I didn't decide to GM because I wanted to *follow rules.*
I became a GM because I wanted to *tell stories.*

Story might have to take a backseat for a while until I really figure out how to follow the rules though.

## The Ugly

Combat was downright awful.
That's all there is to it.
I don't know how to run a combative encounter well.

Part of it was that I used stock monsters, and those don't tend to deal well with 5th level player characters.
They didn't have good weapons nor good strategies.
I wasn't able to play them creatively, so the battle encounters (one of which went on for an hour) just felt like a long grind.

This comes from not knowing the monsters, not knowing the rules, and not knowing enough about the tropes that are familiar with regular D&D players.

## The Conclusion

I'm not a good DM.
I'm *okay*, but not great.
But that's fine.
Practice makes perfect.

Or so I've been told.
