If you know any Linux people, you'll know that many of them seem to have this obsession with
changing the distribution of their operating system every few months.
I am one of these people.
I guess that after so many months of use, Ubuntu just grew too ancient for me.
Or something.
So now I'm running Fedora 28.
I have all kinds of rationalizations for choosing it: it has a better release cycle that lets me use
new software sooner, it's more FOSS than Ubuntu, yadda yadda yadda.
Who knows!
Maybe I'll be happier with it.

I actually distrohopped a week ago, but I only just now got RubyGems working again, which means I
can finally run Jekyll.
For the first day or so, I wasn't able to log into my computer as myself since I had some leftover
configuration files that were mucking everything up.
That's the peril of wanting your computer to work *just so*: you need to be willing to put up with a
lot of things breaking whenever anything changes.
For some reason I keep doing it.

Another motivation to distrohop is that the transition requires me to clean out a lot of the cruft
that builds up on my computer.
Usually I end up completely recustomizing my setup, and this time is no exception: I've tried to put
a little more emphasis on a cohesive theme that affects my window manager, info bar, terminals, etc.
So far I'm enjoying the color schemes that I can get out of
[pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal), which automatically sets my wallpaper and generates a
color scheme to go with it.
I'm sure I can dredge up some screenshots if people care enough to see.

Hopefully this one will hold me for a few months this time.
