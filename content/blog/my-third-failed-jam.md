I've been playing with game development for several years now. I've researched engines and frameworks, looked into drawing, level design, and music programs, and thrown around ideas. I even started programming a few of them. Guess how many I've finished.

I'm not the only one with this problem. Most "game developers" never really get much farther than a working prototype of a few of their core mechanics. While that can be fun --- if you call fiddling with weights until the movement doesn't seem to floaty or heavy "fun" --- it's not as fulfilling as (I imagine) completing a game would be.

"I know," I thought, "I'll join a game jam! That'll give me enough motivation." Alas, it was not to be. Until college, I never really had the time to put in an entire weekend for a game jam -- not when I had to get to school by 7am the following Monday. And Ludum Dare, one of the most popular game jams, never fell during the summer.

Even so, I tried to join two while still in high school. Both times I took a look at the theme, thought and occasionally typed for an hour, and gave up. I blamed this on not having the right software, the right graphics, the right engine --- but really I knew that I needed to grit my teeth and [just do it.](https://i.imgur.com/7524jhl.gif)

So when I came across a game jam for the month of January, I thought "perfect. I'll be able to start on this at the end of winter break, so I'll have the motivation to keep going during the school year." I put my name on the mailing list and sat back contentedly.

Except none of that ever happened. I still haven't started, and I've all but forgotten that I entered in the first place. I don't intend on entering a submission.

That said, I still want this to happen. I still want to be able to say "yes, I made a game." I don't care how small it is, I just want to make it, complete it, and share it.

So for all of those who know a) me and b) a bit of programming, let me know if you're interested in a collaboration at some time when schedules aren't hell. And for every other game programmer looking for inspiration to finally get themselves over the hump: me too.
