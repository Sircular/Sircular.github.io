title: Hi. I'm Walter.
---
I'm a computer science student at the Raikes School in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
My primary interests are machine learning, artificial intelligence, backend development, and data analysis.

Feel free to contact me or check out my [resume](/doc/resume.pdf).

## Projects
At the moment, I'm focused on my computer science degree, but I also have a few side projects I've completed.
If you'd like to take a look at my work, [my Github](https://github.com/Sircular) has my currently active repositories.

I recently participated in [Ludum Dare 41](https://ldjam.com), which is a 48-hour game jam.
You can play my entry [Puzzle Prizon here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/puzzle-prizon)!

All the best,
