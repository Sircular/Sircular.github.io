      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s June of 2019, and political tensions are at an all-time high. Fear of election fraud, either from fears of hacking or double voting, is widespread on all political sides. Do you know what this country needs? Another hot take on the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck system.
Background I&amp;rsquo;ve seen plenty of excellent criticisms leveled at this system. For those of you not familiar with it, the Crosscheck system takes voting records from all participating states, then checks for any duplicate people.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;Disaster Area was a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones and was generally regarded as not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but also as being the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers judged that the best sound balance was usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles away from the stage, whilst the musicians themselves played their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stayed in orbit around the planet - or more frequently around a completely different planet.</description>
