      <description>If you know any Linux people, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that many of them seem to have this obsession with changing the distribution of their operating system every few months. I am one of these people. I guess that after so many months of use, Ubuntu just grew too ancient for me. Or something. So now I&amp;rsquo;m running Fedora 28. I have all kinds of rationalizations for choosing it: it has a better release cycle that lets me use new software sooner, it&amp;rsquo;s more FOSS than Ubuntu, yadda yadda yadda.</description>

      <description>Without going into too much detail, let&amp;rsquo;s just say that I enjoy messing with my workflow far too much. I&amp;rsquo;m constantly trying to get a more efficient setup, a faster, newer, better, shinier plugin, and a more robust tool to use. I have an addiction for configuration. However, for the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a workflow that works pretty consistently for me.
Note-Taking I take all of my notes in Vim.</description>
