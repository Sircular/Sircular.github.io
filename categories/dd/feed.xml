      <description>Good news everyone! I finished my first session as a GM, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t die! I&amp;rsquo;ve found a few strengths and many weaknesses, but I at least have some idea what&amp;rsquo;s going on.
The Preparation I have a couple of close friends who have been GMs before. Neither of them has tons and tons of experience, but they have a good idea of what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. They recommended that I watch all of Matt Colville&amp;rsquo;s Running the Game series.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to start being a Game Master for a D&amp;amp;D game on Friday. I have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.
That&amp;rsquo;s not exactly true. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a world that a friend built, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few ideas going in, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got some generators I can use. But going into something like this with exactly zero experience is always going to be nerve-wracking.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never run an encounter. I&amp;rsquo;ve never run a battle.</description>
